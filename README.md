## My Trips

> A simple website to show pinned places that you went or you want to go

## Getting Started
### Graphql Server

This project uses [Graphql server](https://github.com/lucasfilipess/my-trips-graphql), so you need to run the server first.
### NextJS

After run the [Graphql server](https://github.com/lucasfilipess/my-trips-graphql) and following the steps above, you just need to rename
the `.env.example` to `.env.local` (if you plan to run locally) and edit the keys there.

With all set, you can start the application with:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Commands

- `dev`: runs your application on `localhost:3000`
- `build`: creates the production build version
- `start`: starts a simple server with the build production code
- `lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages
- `test`: runs jest to test all components and pages
- `test:watch`: runs jest in watch mode
